		<h1>Interested in TAing?</h1>
		
		TAs are really important for making courses run. If you're interested in TAing for a course I'm teaching, you should:
		<ol>
			<li> Fill out the official <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/students/ta/ugrad/how_to_apply">CSE application</a> </li>
			<li> Fill out an extra questionnaire I have. For Fall 23, fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfsa4szuulFYS-NNSdtuAiVOaIQEoPksZlIzg50ScIvGgY_YA/viewform?usp=sf_link">this form</a> Send me an email or check back here for a short extra information form that I use.</li>
		</ol>
		
		I use the form to gauge how many potential TAs are interested and help me make my preference list when CSE starts making the TA assignments.
		
		
		<p> If you don't get your first choice TA assignment, don't lose hope! It sometimes takes a few cycles for spaces to open up. In the meantime, you might consider:
		<ol>
			<li> TAing another CSE course if you can. </li>
			<li> Attending TA training. </li>
			<li> Enrolling in CSE 590E, the pedagogy course (CSE 492T), or other teaching-related courses. </li>
		</ol>
		All of these are ways to get better at teaching -- the best way I know is to practice, even if that's just talking about your classes with your friends.
