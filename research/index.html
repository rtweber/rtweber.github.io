		<p> While my main work is teaching classes, teaching track faculty also contribute to scholarship.
		
		<h1> CS Education Research </h1>
		
		<h1> CS Theory Research</h1>
		<p>During my Ph.D. program, my research focused on combinatorial approaches to questions relevant to (theoretical) computer scientists.
			I worked mainly on matching problems.</p> 
			<p> These days, I am not active in cutting edge theory research, though I do occasionally advise mid-career undergraduates in theory research.</p>
			
		
		<h1>Other Scholarship</h1>
		Teaching-track faculty at the University of Washington get to spend some of our time on scholarship. Some of that is publishable research; other work is more internal and not appropriate for publication.

		<p><b><font size=+1>Who to ask for recommendations?</font></b>
		For recommdation letters (whether they're for industry positions or graduate programs), committees are almost always looking for details about you that you couldn't communicate yourself. That means that the best letters come from people who know you well. 
		
		There are lots of ways I might be able to know things about you (e.g., frequently asking or answering questions in class or visiting office hours), but if we haven't interacted frequently enough that I'm not likely to recognize your name in my inbox, you're almost certain to be better off asking someone else. 
		
		
		Process:
		Send me an email at least 3 weeks before the letter submission deadline for your application.
