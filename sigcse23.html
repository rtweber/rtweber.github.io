		<p><b><font size=+1>Who to ask for recommendations?</font></b>
		For recommdation letters (whether they're for industry positions or graduate programs), committees are almost always looking for details about you that you couldn't communicate yourself. That means that the best letters come from people who know you well. 
		
		There are lots of ways I might be able to know things about you (e.g., frequently asking or answering questions in class or visiting office hours), but if we haven't interacted frequently enough that I'm not likely to recognize your name in my inbox, you're almost certain to be better off asking someone else. 
		
		
		Process:
		Send me an email at least 3 weeks before the letter submission deadline for your application.
